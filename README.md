# Finding Falcone - Geek Trust Frontend Challenge

King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is hiding in one of six neighbouring planets. In this problem I build a UI through which King Shan can choose the planets to search, and the vehicles to use in Finding Falcone.

## Features

- Clean Look and feel
- Responsive website
- Popover with ship details on hover over vehicles

## Demo

## Run Locally

In the project directory, you can:

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

It runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Yes! it's that simple.
